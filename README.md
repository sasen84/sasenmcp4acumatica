# MCP4Acumatica

> **Disclaimer:** This project is an independent, community-built integration and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Acumatica, Inc.** "Acumatica" is a registered trademark of Acumatica, Inc. Use of the Acumatica name and API is for interoperability purposes only.

A remote [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server that connects Claude to [Acumatica ERP](https://www.acumatica.com) 2025 R2. Runs on Cloudflare Workers with per-user OAuth authentication against your Acumatica instance.

Each user authenticates with their own Acumatica credentials. Their Acumatica role controls which records they can access. The MCP server additionally requires a specific Acumatica role for access, shows a consent interstitial, and automatically redacts sensitive fields before data reaches the AI model.

## Features

- **51 tools** -- 38 read-only lookups + 6 utility/discovery + 4 schema-knowledge + 2 documentation + 1 write tool (Customer create/update, disabled by default and hidden from clients until enabled) (see [Available Tools](#available-tools))
- **Per-user OAuth** -- users log in with their Acumatica credentials (or SSO)
- **Role-based access** -- Acumatica's security model governs what each user sees
- **Access gate** -- only users who can read a designated canary Generic Inquiry can connect (restrict it however you like; a marker role such as `MCP Access` is the recommended way)
- **Consent interstitial** -- users must acknowledge AI data processing before accessing tools
- **Sensitive field redaction** -- SSN, bank accounts, salary, and other PII fields are automatically redacted before data leaves the server
- **Rate limiting** -- 3 concurrent requests and 40 requests/minute per user by default, both adjustable from the admin console. A request that finds all slots busy waits briefly for one instead of failing outright, and a rejection returns a structured `{ error: "rate_limited", retryAfterSeconds, actionRequired }` envelope telling the AI exactly how long to wait rather than to retry in a loop
- **Pagination refusal** -- list/query tools return a structured `{ truncated, paginationSupported: false, actionRequired }` envelope when results hit the record cap, instructing the AI to ask the user for a narrower filter rather than calling the tool again
- **Structured audit logging** -- all tool invocations, auth events, and field redactions are logged
- **Admin console** -- web-based admin interface at `/docs/admin` for viewing logs and managing runtime settings without redeploying
- **Long-term log retention** -- R2-backed log storage via Cloudflare Logpush with searchable log viewer

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) >= 18
- A [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) account (Workers paid plan for Durable Objects)
- An Acumatica 2025 R2 instance with:
  - A **Connected Application** configured in SM303010 with the **Authorization Code** OAuth 2.0 flow (scopes are sent by the server in the request, not configured on the app)
  - A redirect URI pointing to your worker's `/callback` endpoint
  - An **`MCPAccess` Generic Inquiry** (SM208000) -- a trivial canary GI with **Expose via OData** enabled; the login access gate checks whether the user can read it (see [Architecture docs](docs/architecture.md) for details). The GI name is configurable via `ACUMATICA_CANARY_GI`.
  - A way to restrict who can read that GI -- a marker **`MCP Access` role** (SM201005) assigned only to permitted users is the recommended approach

## Setup

There are three install paths. All three rely on the same Acumatica-side prerequisites — finish those first (see "[Acumatica-side configuration](#acumatica-side-configuration)" below) regardless of which path you pick.

| Path | Best for | Terminal needed? |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **A. Deploy to Cloudflare button** | Adopters who want a fully GUI install | No |
| **B. One-line installer** | Developers who already have `git` / `node` / `npm` | Yes (one command) |
| **C. Manual setup** | Anyone who wants to inspect each step | Yes |

### Path A — Deploy to Cloudflare button (no terminal)

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/hallboys/MCP4Acumatica)

The button forks this repo to your GitHub account, reads `wrangler.jsonc`, auto-creates the KV namespace and R2 bucket, prompts for secrets, and deploys. Step-by-step:

1. **Click the button.** Cloudflare will ask you to sign in (or create an account) and authorize a GitHub fork.
2. **Confirm bindings.** You'll be prompted to create KV namespaces **twice** — once for the `TOKEN_STORE` binding (app data: tokens, OAuth state, cache, config, admin sessions) and once for `OAUTH_KV` (used internally by the OAuth library). This is expected: they're two separate bindings and never share keys.

   > ⚠️ **Give the two namespaces _different_ names** (e.g. `mcp4acumatica-app` for `TOKEN_STORE` and `mcp4acumatica-oauth` for `OAUTH_KV`). Cloudflare auto-provisioning derives the default title from the Worker name, so **both fields default to `mcp4acumatica` — and creating two namespaces with the same title fails** with *"Cannot provision a KV Namespace with the title … because it already exists."* If you already hit that error, a half-finished namespace was left behind: go to **Storage & Databases → KV** and delete the orphaned `mcp4acumatica` namespace, then retry with two distinct names. (Cloudflare's GUI auto-provisioning can't point both bindings at one namespace, and config can't pre-set distinct titles — so two separate namespaces with distinct names is the way. If the GUI keeps failing, use a terminal install path below: `setup.sh` creates one namespace and binds both to it.)

   The R2 buckets (`mcp4acumatica-logs`, `mcp4acumatica-index`) are created the same way, but their names are fixed in `wrangler.jsonc` so they don't collide.
3. **Set secrets.** When prompted, paste:
   - `ACUMATICA_CLIENT_ID` — from your Connected Application (SM303010)
   - `ACUMATICA_CLIENT_SECRET` — from the same screen
   - `COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — open your browser console on any page and run:
     ```js
     [...crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32))].map(b => b.toString(16).padStart(2,'0')).join('')
     ```
     Copy the resulting 64-character hex string.
   - `ADMIN_SECRET` — any password you'll remember (protects the `/docs/admin` console). Generate one with `[...crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(24))].map(b => b.toString(16).padStart(2,'0')).join('')` if you don't have a preference.
4. **Deploy.** Cloudflare connects the fork to Workers Builds and pushes the first deployment.
5. **Update the Acumatica vars.** After the deploy completes, open `Workers & Pages → mcp4acumatica → Settings → Variables and Secrets` in the Cloudflare dashboard and edit:
   - `ACUMATICA_URL` (e.g. `https://yourcompany.acumatica.com`)
   - `ACUMATICA_TENANT` (your login company)
   - Optionally `ACUMATICA_MAX_RECORDS`, `ACUMATICA_CANARY_GI`, `REDACT_PATTERNS`, `REDACT_SKIP`
   Click **Save and Deploy** — Cloudflare redeploys with the new values.
6. **Add a redirect URI to your Connected Application.** Your worker is now reachable at `https://mcp4acumatica.<your-account>.workers.dev`. Add `https://<that-host>/callback` to the redirect URIs in Acumatica's SM303010 screen. (To use a custom domain instead, see "[Custom domain](#custom-domain-optional)" below.)
7. **Test the deploy.** Visit `https://<your-host>/docs/admin/preflight`, log in with your `ADMIN_SECRET`, and run the preflight diagnostic. It probes Acumatica connectivity, the OIDC discovery endpoint, the Connected App credentials, the tenant path, and the contract API version — any misconfiguration is called out by name.

After this point Claude can connect (see "[Connecting Claude](#connecting-claude)" below).

### Path B — One-line installer (terminal)

If you already have `git`, `node`, and `npm`, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://mcp4acumatica.hallboys.com/install.sh | bash
```

This clones the repo, installs dependencies, and runs `./setup.sh`. The setup script prompts for the Acumatica values you must supply (URL, tenant, Connected App client ID and secret), auto-generates the crypto secrets, creates the KV namespace and R2 bucket, uploads secrets, deploys, and then runs the preflight check.

If you prefer to inspect the script first:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://mcp4acumatica.hallboys.com/install.sh -o install.sh
less install.sh   # read it
bash install.sh   # then run
```

### Path C — Manual setup (terminal)

#### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hallboys/MCP4Acumatica.git
cd MCP4Acumatica
npm install
```

#### 2. Create KV namespace

```bash
npx wrangler kv namespace create TOKEN_STORE
```

Note the namespace ID from the output — you'll paste it into `wrangler.jsonc` next. The same ID is used for both the `TOKEN_STORE` and `OAUTH_KV` bindings.

#### 3. Configure wrangler

`wrangler.jsonc` is tracked in the repo as the deploy template. Edit it in place and fill in:

- The KV namespace ID from step 2 (both `TOKEN_STORE` and `OAUTH_KV` bindings — same id)
- `ACUMATICA_URL` — your Acumatica instance URL (e.g. `https://yourcompany.acumatica.com`)
- `ACUMATICA_TENANT` — your Acumatica company/tenant name

To keep your local values out of `git status` (so you can still pull updates without conflicts):

```bash
git update-index --skip-worktree wrangler.jsonc
```

#### 4. Set secrets

```bash
npx wrangler secret put ACUMATICA_CLIENT_ID
npx wrangler secret put ACUMATICA_CLIENT_SECRET
npx wrangler secret put COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY      # use `openssl rand -hex 32`
npx wrangler secret put ADMIN_SECRET                # any password — protects /docs/admin
```

#### 5. Deploy

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

#### 6. Local development (optional)

```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
# Edit .dev.vars with your Acumatica credentials
npx wrangler dev
```

### Acumatica-side configuration

These steps are required regardless of which install path you pick. They can't be automated — Acumatica's API doesn't expose them.

#### Connected Application (SM303010)

1. In Acumatica: **System > Integration > Connected Applications (SM303010)**.
2. Create a new Connected Application.
3. Set the **OAuth 2.0 Flow** to **Authorization Code**.
4. Add a redirect URI: `https://<your-worker-url>/callback` (use the `*.workers.dev` hostname or your custom domain).
5. Note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** — you'll provide these as secrets during deploy.

> There is no scope field to configure here. OAuth scopes (`api openid profile email offline_access`, including the `offline_access` that makes Acumatica issue refresh tokens) are sent by the MCP server in the authorization request — they aren't set on the Connected Application.

#### Access gate: canary Generic Inquiry (SM208000, SM201005)

Before a user can access the AI tools, the login flow runs an **access gate**: it queries a trivial canary Generic Inquiry over OData and checks whether the user's token can read it (200 → allowed, 403 → denied). The server never inspects Acumatica role membership — it only asks "can you see this one GI?". You restrict who can read the canary GI however your security model prefers; a marker role is the recommended, tidiest way.

1. **Create the canary GI:** **System > Customization > Generic Inquiry (SM208000)** → create a GI named `MCPAccess` with any trivial query (a single column from any table is fine). Enable **Expose via OData**.
2. **Restrict who can read it (recommended: a marker role):** **System > Access Rights > User Roles (SM201005)** → create a role named `MCP Access` with no screen permissions, assign the `MCPAccess` GI only to that role, then assign the role to each user who should have AI assistant access. Any other mechanism that controls OData read access to the GI works too.

> The canary GI name is configurable via the `ACUMATICA_CANARY_GI` variable (default `MCPAccess`). Edit it in the Cloudflare dashboard (`Variables and Secrets`) or in `wrangler.jsonc`.

#### Generic Inquiry exposure to AI (strongly recommended)

A mature Acumatica instance can have **hundreds** of Generic Inquiries, most built for human screens (wide report grids, dashboards, ad-hoc queries). Exposing all of them to the assistant floods its context and makes it pick the wrong inquiry — and, worse, a **parameterized GI exposed via OData returns silently wrong data**: queried without its parameters, Acumatica returns default/unfiltered rows with **no error**, which the model cannot detect. The **GI exposure gate** flips this to opt-in: you tag the GIs that are genuinely useful *and correct* for an AI agent to query (`ExposedToMCP`), and the model sees only those.

The gate is **inactive until you configure it** — the server runs, but with no registry the assistant **cannot discover GIs** (`acumatica_list_generic_inquiries` returns nothing; a user can still run a GI by exact name). Configuring it gives the assistant a curated set it can safely discover. Enabling it is a one-time Acumatica **customization project** — bundled in [`acumatica/`](acumatica/), it adds the custom fields `UsrExposedToMCP` / `UsrAIDescription` (`GIDesign`) and `UsrResAIDescription` (`GIResult`) plus the SM208000 form changes — followed by the `MCPGIs` / `MCPGIFields` feed GIs, read access on the feeds for the `MCP Access` role, and tagging the GIs you want exposed. See [docs/generic-inquiries.md](docs/generic-inquiries.md).

> See **[Generic Inquiries](docs/generic-inquiries.md)** for the full rationale, how to decide which GIs to expose, and step-by-step setup.

### Custom domain (optional)

The deploy gives you a `*.workers.dev` hostname out of the box. To attach a branded hostname:

- **Via the Cloudflare dashboard:** `Workers & Pages → mcp4acumatica → Settings → Domains & Routes → Add`. The domain's zone must be on your Cloudflare account.
- **Via `wrangler.jsonc`:** uncomment the `routes` block at the top of the file, edit `pattern` and `zone_name`, redeploy.

If you change hostnames, remember to add the new `https://<host>/callback` to your Connected Application's redirect URIs in SM303010.

## Connecting Claude

### Claude.ai / Claude Desktop

1. Go to **Settings > Connectors**
2. Click **Add Connector** and enter the URL: `https://<your-worker-url>/mcp`
3. On first use, you'll be redirected to your Acumatica login page
4. If your account can read the canary GI (i.e. you've been granted access), you'll see a consent page explaining AI data processing
5. After acknowledging consent, Claude will have access to the tools — 50 by default; the write tool appears only after an administrator enables write tools

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
claude mcp add acumatica-erp --transport streamable-http https://<your-worker-url>/mcp
```

### API (via Anthropic SDK)

When using the Anthropic API with MCP, point the MCP client to `https://<your-worker-url>/mcp`. The server supports OAuth 2.1 with Dynamic Client Registration at `/register`.

### Microsoft 365 Copilot (custom federated connector)

Copilot connects through a **custom federated connector** (Microsoft 365 admin center → **Copilot** → **Connectors** → **Gallery** → *Create a new connector* → **Connect to MCP server**). Copilot only enables tools that carry the `readOnlyHint` annotation; every tool here is annotated (0.53.0+), so the read tools are available. With write tools disabled (the default), the write tool is hidden and the server is entirely read-only from Copilot's point of view.

The connector form takes an OAuth registration ID rather than performing Dynamic Client Registration, so register a client by hand first:

1. **Register an OAuth client with this server.** `POST https://<your-worker-url>/register` with the Teams redirect URI; keep the returned `client_id` and `client_secret`:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST https://<your-worker-url>/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"client_name":"Microsoft 365 Copilot","redirect_uris":["https://teams.microsoft.com/api/platform/v1.0/oAuthRedirect"]}'
   ```
2. **Register it in the [Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/)** (**Tools** → **OAuth client registration**): client ID/secret from step 1, authorization endpoint `https://<your-worker-url>/authorize`, token and refresh endpoints `https://<your-worker-url>/token`, PKCE on. Copy the **OAuth client registration ID** it produces.
3. **Create the connector** in the admin center: base URL `https://<your-worker-url>/mcp`, and paste the registration ID.
4. **Scope the rollout.** A new connector defaults to visible to everyone in the tenant — restrict it right after creating it. Users still need the Acumatica `MCP Access` gate like any other client.
5. After a server upgrade that changes the tool list, users must disconnect and reconnect the connector in Copilot (**Settings** → **Sources**) to reload it.

Microsoft's reference: [Set up custom federated connectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/copilot/connectors/set-up-custom-federated-connectors). Steps 1, 4 and 5 are as reported by the contributor who production-tested this ([PR #3](https://github.com/hallboys/MCP4Acumatica/pull/3)); the redirect URI and portal fields match Microsoft's docs.

## Skills

Reusable Claude skills that ship with this repo, in [`skills/`](skills/):

- **[acumatica-gi-descriptions](skills/acumatica-gi-descriptions/)** -- End-to-end process for writing AI-facing descriptions for Generic Inquiries and their result columns, grounded in the GI's own design metadata (tables, joins, WHERE conditions, columns) rather than guessed from names. Includes the platform tripwires that make bulk GI metadata work go silently wrong, a checklist of design signals worth hunting, and three scripts for truncation auditing, design briefing, and draft validation.

To use it, point Claude at the skill directory, or copy it into your own `.claude/skills/`.

## Related

- **[acumatica-claude-kit](https://github.com/hallboys/acumatica-claude-kit)** -- A Claude Code plugin of hard-won Acumatica integration gotchas for contract-based REST and OData Generic Inquiries: auth/session traps, GIQL pitfalls, silent no-op writes, and idempotency rules, each tagged UNIVERSAL vs TENANT. It pairs well with this server: MCP4Acumatica gives Claude live access to your instance, the kit gives it the platform knowledge to use that access correctly.

  ```
  /plugin marketplace add hallboys/acumatica-claude-kit
  /plugin install acumatica-claude-kit@acumatica-claude-kit
  ```

## Security

- **No stored credentials.** The MCP server does not store Acumatica passwords. It uses OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow -- users authenticate directly with Acumatica.
- **Per-user tokens.** Each user's Acumatica access token is stored in the platform key-value store (Cloudflare KV on the default deployment), scoped to their username. Tokens are automatically refreshed when expired. If a refresh token expires, the connection re-authenticates automatically instead of requiring a manual reconnect.
- **Access gate.** Only users who can read a designated canary Generic Inquiry can connect. The server checks GI-readability over OData during login (not role membership); users without access see an access denied page. Restrict the GI however you like — a marker `MCP Access` role is the recommended way. The GI name is configurable via `ACUMATICA_CANARY_GI`.
- **Consent interstitial.** After passing the access check, users must acknowledge that their data will be processed by an external AI model before the MCP session activates.
- **Sensitive field redaction.** Tool responses are automatically scanned for sensitive field names (SSN, bank accounts, salary, credit card, etc.) and matched values are replaced with `[REDACTED]`. Patterns are configurable via `REDACT_PATTERNS` and `REDACT_SKIP` environment variables.
- **Role-based access.** The user's Acumatica role determines which records they can read. If a user doesn't have access to a record in Acumatica, they won't be able to access it through the MCP server either.
- **Read-only.** All current tools are read-only lookups. No data is created, modified, or deleted.
- **Rate limiting.** 3 concurrent requests, 40 requests per minute, and a 1000-record cap per query by default -- all configurable from the admin console at `/docs/admin/settings` without redeploying. Limits are per user and count HTTP calls to Acumatica (not tool invocations). Rejections return a structured envelope with an exact `retryAfterSeconds` and are logged as `rate_limit_hit` events so you can tell whether the caps are too tight.
- **Pagination refusal.** The list/query tools (`acumatica_list_entities`, `acumatica_run_inquiry`, `acumatica_list_generic_inquiries`) do not support pagination. When a response hits `ACUMATICA_MAX_RECORDS`, the tool returns a structured envelope (`truncated: true`, `paginationSupported: false`, `actionRequired: "..."`) instructing the AI to stop and ask the user for a narrower filter rather than retrieving more records.
- **Audit logging.** All tool invocations, auth events (login success/denied, consent accepted), and field redaction events are logged as structured JSON. View with `npx wrangler tail`.

## Platform Portability

While the default deployment targets Cloudflare Workers, the tool handlers and core libraries are platform-agnostic. A storage abstraction (`IKeyValueStore` interface + `AppEnv` type) decouples tool logic from Cloudflare-specific APIs, enabling self-hosted deployments on Node.js with Redis, SQLite, or other storage backends. See the [Self-Hosting Guide](docs/self-hosting-guide.md) for details.
